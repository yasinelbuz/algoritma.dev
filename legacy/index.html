            <p>Notepad++ is a free (as in “free speech” and also as in “free beer”) source code editor and Notepad
                replacement that supports several languages. Running in the MS Windows environment, its use is governed
                by GNU General Public License.</p>

            <p>Based on the powerful editing component Scintilla, Notepad++ is written in C++ and uses pure Win32 API
                and STL which ensures a higher execution speed and smaller program size. By optimizing as many routines
                as possible without losing user friendliness, Notepad++ is trying to reduce the world carbon dioxide
                emissions. When using less CPU power, the PC can throttle down and reduce power consumption, resulting
                in a greener environment.</p>
